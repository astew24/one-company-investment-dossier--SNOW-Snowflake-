Snowflake (SNOW) — cloud-based data warehousing & analytics platform.

Public Equity (growth SaaS, misunderstood mid/large-cap with one core product).

I think Snowflake is undervalued because its expansion into AI-driven data applications will accelerate product adoption and revenue growth over the next 3–5 years, while the market is still pricing it primarily as a slowing data warehouse provider.
